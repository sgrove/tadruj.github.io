monolitic kernel (linux, freebsd, openbsd)
* general purpuse OS
* booting in different architectures
* device drivers
* provide API for applications to run
* provide TCP-IP stack, shell interface, filesystems, storage protocols
= clustered environment where you have to obey what the kernel wants you to do

microkernel (mobile, embedded)
* many different services that operate independently
* minimize on the privilege they have
* they communicate with other components = like distributed systems
= usually elegant design, bad performance

exokernels = hybrids
* let the entire application link to kernel subsystems
* apps specialize themselves based on what their needs are
* exokernel for example links webapp and network card so nothing else can use it
* no other users, no other applications

unikernel

hypervisor (vmware, xen)
* carve up physical machine into multiple virtual machines
* type1 hypervisor = enumerates memory, cpu and cores, configures interop system
* boots domain0 OS, that runs physical device drivers
* domain guest operating systems have the illusion they are running inside physical machine
* xen is faking physical devices and proxying requests for network and block devices
= physical machines consolidator

typical stack
* physical machine
* type1 hypervisor
* domain0 OS
* guest VM
* guest kernel
* userspace executes application
* high level language runtime with garbage collectors JVM .NET
* threads
* app logic
= mirage transfers this complexity to the compiler

mirage
* compile specialized appliance for one purpose only
* all the unneeded functionality is discarded at compile time
+ usual case is that you spin up separate instances for database or webserver
+ apps dont care so much about binary compatibility, because they call services over network protocols
* no worries about backwards compatibility and supporting many device drivers = xen server is standardized and the same in Amazon, Rackspace...
= write nice high level code and synthesize it with little specialized kernels and not be a kernel programmer

mirage optimizes accross the stack, including OS, network stack etc at compile time, 
run GCC optimizes an object file
run executable in the kernel and stops there with optimizatons

mirage development process
* goal homepages - blogging and wiki -> needs DNS & HTTP
* DNS is UDP is IP = 100K size
* HTTP needs TCP needs DHCP needs Ethernet stack needs Xen device drivers (1 year in OCaml from scratch)

* next, no filesystem but Database, based on GIT with version control
* when mirage kernel starts it forks its storage from a git database
* all of the changes are written into a branch
* and reconsiled and pushed back to a central git repo
* which can be hosted on github
* unikernel binaries are very small, so they are usually commited together with a source code
* replicating drivers like FAT32(usb sticks) doesnt really benefit anything in the unikernel world
* working on git, things like that are killer applications

* software that runs the cloud itself: xen
* xen is running on 100.000 hosts and each host has 100 of guests
* datacenter that is running millions of these virtual machines
* management stack that will deal with the concerns of how to start and stop these VMs in a secure way 
* configure storage on network, network topology
* this is currently running on domain0
* theyre focusing on domain0 now, storage breaks, reboots, works, networking is unaffected
* mirage was used to build a control stack for this system
* citrix maintains Xen

effectiveness
* depends of the nature of your workloads
* phone 3G needs to be completely firewalled away from App Store = you care less about resources and more about isolation
* cloud workloads - serving a lot of network connections with the minimum resources
* mirage collapses a stack on the guest VM space

benchmarking
* 2 wins
* straightforward troughput 10Gbit speeds with much less CPU
* non-obvious: latency - fewer layers of abstraciton
* boot time in miliseconds (reduces time in cloud)
* xen supports 60~100GBits troughputs on the same machine via shared memory rings
* web server is on the same host as database
* linux on domain0 cant deal with that
* building a new networking stack called fable that will probe for a possible shared mem connection, then TCP and then other strategies
* with networking proocols theres always a problem of IO myths and layers of abstraction
* new clean slate SSL stack for mirage - Wild West of Unix IO
* primary goal in cloud is end to end security and secure memory, heartbleed would throw an exception, because OCaml check for memory safety.

* OCaml modules enable to take a lot of small modules and build larger without violating any safety guarantees - module programming is similar than OO, but it doesnt mix state and data transformations

benefits of mirage
* low level memory bounce checking and garbage collection
* high level modular programming
 
OCaml is a garbage collector language

toolchain
* opam library system
* binary called mirage
* give unikernel source code for the site and specification how to compile
* compile webserver to run on local machine to debug it locally
* compile it for MacOS and Linux using Mirage tcp/ip stack
* finally recompile into a Xen microkernel, all from the same build system and source tree
* glue: travis 
* push source to github
* travis builds it up
* travis pushes to another github repo
* from git push to deployment 7 minutes, in some rebuild cases 5 seconds, goal miliseconds

other languages - Ruby, Python
* have to build an unikernel for them
* HaLVM is a Haskell equivalent of Mirage
* Java OSV
* Erlang version too
* Mirage has focus on new stuff, not supporting old, legacy stuff
* so rewrite and restructure it and the process of doing this in OCaml improves it significally

mirage inside of browser
* personal data management
* dropbox, facebook, google is centralised
* entire stack is handled by embedded devices running on ARM nodes, so the unikernels will run on the edges of the networks, like IoT devices and appliances at home, this way privacy can be ensured
* xen got support for ARM = arm boards, not only x86 - chromebooks
* mirage version that compiles to Raspberry Pi kernel
* edge cloud - network of devices that are as easy to use as a cloud, but operate on the edges and are self organizing, self managing, self encrypting - provide people to run their own little clouds
* system is called mymote

OCaml
* standard library is minimal, thats why Jane Street released core
* hundreds of data structures extremely fast
* RealWorld OCaml introduces core to the world
* no tutorial how to build a compiler :)
* building web services ... JSON, small stuff

OCaml History
* extension of writing formal systems = describing computer science concepts
* = standard ML
* 1986 OCaml was released by Inria
* 1996 OCaml in current form
* Included interested object system on top of it  
* coq is written in OCaml
* Rust originally was built using OCaml
* last 10 years libraries for Network based stuff

JSOcaml
* ocaml bytecode to javascript
* Hack for HHVM (PHPVM) is written in OCaml - IDE typechecking in the browser as theyre writing code
* iOS, Android backends, microcontrollers, OSes, kernel modules 

deployment
* openstack
* cloudstack
* amazon

if you give mirage a try, if error, pull request
write a blog post about how did you run the kenrel in one of the deployment environments
create github issues
tell what youre up to, they need motivation
reconfigure = recompile & redeploy
